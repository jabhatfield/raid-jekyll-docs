This deep dive outlines the main concepts of the Handwriting Recogniser
inner workings.

# Neural networks

A neural network is an artificial representation of the human brain. It
comprises computational nodes and their weighted interconnections,
analogous to neurons and synapses. Input data flows though layers of
nodes, with node output determined by incoming weights plus a
mathematical function called an [activation
function](#_rectified_linear_unit_activation_function).

Prior to user input, weights are randomly initialized and iteratively
trained on training data, to refine the model, until one of the
following occurs:

-   The training algorithm converges, meaning it reaches a stable value.

-   The specified number of iterations is reached.

# Multilayer perceptron

Handwriting Recogniser implements a **multilayer perceptron** (**MLP**)
neural network trained on the [MNIST
database,window=\_blank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database)
of handwritten numbers. An MLP consists of multiple layers, as
illustrated in [???](#mlp-diagram):

-   **Input layer**: contains the input data

-   **Hidden layer**: calculates output to the next layer

-   **Output layer**: calculates the result

The hidden layer is the core of the network. It contains the functions
that activate nodes and recalculate weights. The network can have
multiple hidden layers, depending on the complexity of its
functionality.

The MLP has the following characteristics, which are explained in
following sections:

-   [Feedforward processing](#_feedforward_processing)

-   [Backpropagation](#_backpropagation)

-   [Gradient descent](#_gradient_descent)

-   [Rectified Linear Unit activation
    function](#_rectified_linear_unit_activation_function)

-   [Softmax activation function](#_softmax_activation_function)

# Feedforward processing

In a feedforward neural network, information flows in one direction,
from input towards output. This design suits classification tasks, such
as image recognition, because it allows an independent variable (the
input to classify) to map to specified dependent variables (output
classification options).

The alternative to feedforward is recurrent neural networks, whereby
information can flow in loops. This allows memory within the network,
making these networks suited for processing sequential data that relies
on prior input, such as speech recognition data.

# Backpropagation

The neural network uses its state, in terms of weights, to predict an
outcome. During training, the discrepancy between predicted and actual
outcome is calculated by a *loss function*, which is a mathematical
representation of error, and this error must be minimised in order to
optimise the network. Backpropagation is the calculation of the rate of
change, or derivative, of the loss function, for each weight. Since a
derivative indicates the direction in which a function increases, the
negative of the derivative is used to indicate the direction of loss
function minimisation and therefore optimisation.

Backpropagation only ascertains how to optimise the network, it does not
perform the optimisation itself. [Gradient descent](#_gradient_descent)
performs the optimisation.

# Gradient descent

Gradient descent is an algorithm that descends the gradient defined by
[backpropagation](#_backpropagation). It amends the network weights
iteratively until the loss function is minimised. This is analogous to
descending a mountain peak, in steps, in the direction of the steepest
slope, until the lowest valley is reached. See
[???](#gradient-descent-diagram) for a visualisation of the process.

# Rectified Linear Unit activation function

An activation function calculates node output based on the input. If the
output exceeds a defined threshold, the node is activated and passes
data onwards through its outward connections. Activation functions are
typically non-linear in order to introduce variance and therefore learn;
a linear function would simply propagate input. Handwriting Recogniser
uses the **Rectified Linear Unit** (**ReLU**) activation function, which
returns output as equal to the input when the value is positive,
otherwise it returns zero (see [???](#relu-activation-diagram)).

</figure>

The activation function is also involved in the
[backpropagation](#_backpropagation) derivative calculations. Notice
that the derivative of ReLU is 0 for negative values and 1 for positive
values, as illustrated in [???](#relu-derivative-diagram).

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">ReLU derivative</figcaption>
</figure>

The derivative of the activation function is important for preventing
the vanishing gradient problem, whereby the backpropagation derivatives
prematurely approach 0 during [gradient descent](#_gradient_descent),
causing the network to learn slowly or not at all. Vanishing gradients
occur when implementing an activation function with derivatives that are
close to 0 for many input values, such as the sigmoid function (see
[???](#sigmoid-derivative-diagram)).

</figure>

Compare the ReLU derivatives in [???](#relu-derivative-diagram) with the
sigmoid derivatives in [???](#sigmoid-derivative-diagram). Notice how
ReLU has a wider selection of weights that result in significant
derivatives (close to 1). ReLU is therefore more likely to make progress
during gradient descent and reach an optimal solution.

# Softmax activation function

The softmax function is used in the final layer of the network, instead
of the [ReLU activation
function](#_rectified_linear_unit_activation_function), to output the
result. It normalises the output values to probabilities of correctness
between 0 and 1. These probabilities sum up to 1 and can therefore be
regarded as percentages.
