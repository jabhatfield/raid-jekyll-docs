If the output exceeds a defined threshold, the node is activated and passes data onwards through its outward connections. Activation functions are typically non-linear in order to introduce variance and therefore learn; a linear function would simply propagate input. Handwriting Recogniser uses the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, which returns output as equal to the input when the value is positive, otherwise it returns zero (see Figure 3). Figure 3. ReLU activation function The activation function is also involved in the backpropagation derivative calculations. Notice that the derivative of ReLU is 0 for negative values and 1 for positive values, as illustrated in Figure 4. Figure 4. ReLU derivative The derivative of the activation function is important for preventing the vanishing gradient problem, whereby the backpropagation derivatives prematurely approach 0 during gradient descent, causing the network to learn slowly or not at all. Vanishing gradients occur when implementing an activation function with derivatives that are close to 0 for many input values, such as the sigmoid function (see Figure 5). Figure 5. Sigmoid derivative Compare the ReLU derivatives in Figure 4 with the sigmoid derivatives in Figure 5. Notice how ReLU has a wider selection of weights that result in significant derivatives (close to 1). ReLU is therefore more likely to make progress during gradient descent and reach an optimal solution. ",

The training algorithm is based on a PhD dissertation by Grzegorz Chrupala and performs two main functions: . | Specialised suffixation: many word inflections affect the suffix, for example big can become bigger or biggest. The lemma big is formed by traversing from the end of the inflected word and performing a series of insertions and deletions. | Generalised prefixation and suffixation: word forms inapplicable to specialised suffixation are traversed from both the beginning and the end to find the longest common substring, or stem. For example, the Polish words for hard and hardest are trudny and najtrudniejszy respectively, and they share the stem of trudn.

The chatbot then trains a maximum entropy model of lemmatized classification data in order to choose the most probable response.

The chatbot implements the bag-of-words model, which involves creating a set of unique words from the data and counting their occurrences. A category with relatively more occurrences of a word is more likely to be selected when that word is present in the input. See the following simplified example based on a small extract of the data: .

    "content": "The maximum entropy algorithm finds a probability distribution that maximises entropy, within constraints dictated by the data. Consider a dice roll as an example. A dice roll has high entropy, meaning that it’s unpredictable, with a uniformly spread out probability distribution (see Figure 1). Empirical training data will indicate this uniform distribution and therefore impose no real constraint, since the model already exhibits maximum entropy. Figure 1. Regular dice with high entropy Suppose the dice is weighted in favour of rolling a 6. A naive algorithm might model the dice as always rolling a 6 and therefore indicate zero entropy (see Figure 2). A lack of entropy results in failure to represent outliers; however, as illustrated in Figure 1, too much entropy results in a vague model of randomness. A realistic weighted dice is somewhere between the two probability distributions. Figure 2. Unrealistic weighted dice with zero entropy Consider the same weighted dice modelled with maximum entropy. The algorithm will maximise entropy by assigning importance to outliers (values 1-5). However, the outliers will be considered less significant than the more common value of 6 because the algorithm is constrained by the data, which favours a value of 6. The model is specific enough to show trends yet generic enough to include less common outcomes (see Figure 3). Figure 3. Realistic weighted dice with low entropy The Zoo Chatbot resembles this weighted dice example, except the algorithm is constrained by the mapping of input data to output data during training, as opposed to a favoured side of a dice. The maximum entropy algorithm favours output based on the mappings whilst maximising the probabilities of less likely outputs. ",
